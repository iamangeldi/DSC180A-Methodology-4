## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
In general, it was the idea of creating an algorithm that, without any explicit retraining, can remove some (if not most) of the influence of the forget set—basically the core goal for all machine unlearning enthusiasts. I also really enjoyed seeing how multifaceted the task is, with so many different ways to evaluate and measure performance.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Since our goal this quarter was to replicate an existing algorithm, I’m really excited about trying to design something new. I’d love to test it on additional datasets and/or even LLMs, which are the main “targets” of machine unlearning algorithms. I’m also very interested in digging deeper into machine unlearning metrics—right now many metrics are tailored to specific use cases, so exploring something more universal that could work across many unlearning setups sounds especially appealing.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
My initial mistake was not doing enough due diligence on my preferred method. Going forward, I’d like to invest more time upfront into researching the method, especially since there aren’t always universal equations or standard implementations, and small differences can have a big impact on performance.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d be interested in trying another machine unlearning method and comparing how it performs under the same evaluation setup.
